      <h2>Whether living on campus or off campus, most students will experience living with other people 
        in small spaces for the first time. Currently, many people will draw their own crude floor plans 
        or be forced to alter their furniture or belongings to fit the space available. Our goal is to 
        create a collaborative design application that allows users to silutaneously create and edit
        custom floorplans.</h2>
